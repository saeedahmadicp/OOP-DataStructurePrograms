Dear Madam!

   The third question given by the Sir is include the 2nd question,
i.e. merge_sort.cpp file. I have measured the execution time within this 
file. When the user enter the number of element to be in the array. The
program will automatically randomly initialize the array and then the 
execution time of the merge_sort algorithm will be calculate automatically
within the program in microseconds.

Thanks
